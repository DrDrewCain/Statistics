#2. Plot the data fit with a smoothing spline with the default cross validation, vs the smoothing spline with 2 degrees of freedom (linear fit).

#3. Test the difference of fit using the F test

#4. Plot the normal quantile-quantile plots for the residuals 

#5 Create a histogram plot showing the difference.
